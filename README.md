# Ozen Kashevet

Welcome to Ozen Kashevet, a project developed during the Wix hackathon aimed at providing support for individuals experiencing post-traumatic stress from war-related experiences. Our platform offers a safe and anonymous space for users to connect with therapists, engage in peer-to-peer support, and access helpful resources.
