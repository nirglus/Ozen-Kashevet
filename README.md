# Ozen Kashevet

Welcome to Ozen Kashevet, a project developed during the Wix hackathon aimed at providing support for individuals experiencing post-traumatic stress from war-related experiences. Our platform offers a safe and anonymous space for users to connect with therapists, engage in peer-to-peer support, and access helpful resources.

## Project Overview

Ozen Kashevet is designed to address the mental health needs of individuals and warriors affected by the war between Israel and Hamas, as well as those impacted by exposure to distressing content. Our platform facilitates communication between users and therapists, allowing for confidential conversations and access to professional support.

## Features

### Anonymous Therapy Sessions
Users can schedule anonymous therapy sessions with licensed therapists to discuss their experiences and receive personalized support.

### Peer Support
Our platform enables users to engage in peer-to-peer support by connecting with others who have similar experiences. This allows for sharing of coping strategies, encouragement, and empathy.

### AI Chatbot Therapist
We've integrated an AI chatbot therapist capable of providing immediate support and guidance for individuals in need of short-term therapy solutions.

### Resource Hub
Users can explore a collection of helpful articles and resources curated to address various aspects of post-traumatic stress and mental health.
